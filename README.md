  &lt;strong>Moatermouth&lt;/strong> is the alias of &lt;strong>Anjel Robinson&lt;/strong> — a Cincinnati-based   Games &amp;amp; Animation artist, illustrator, and storyteller. I create expressive, character-driven   worlds that mix surreal emotion, color, and humor to explore what it means to be human (and not quite human). &lt;/p>
